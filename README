This is (as you probably guessed) a Lisp interpreter.

Current language features are as follows:

* Four data types,

  three types of atoms:
    * numbers -- like 1, 2, 3 (i.e. only integers)
    * symbols -- like `foo', `bar', ..
    * strings -- like the infamous "Hello world !"

  and the fourth being (immutable) cons cells.

* Two special forms:

  * lambda -- creates a function
  * cond   -- branches by evaluating conditions

* Exceptions (but no way to catch them)

* An _extensive_ set of builtin functions:

  * as many as four (!) arithmetic integer operations (+, -, *, /)
  * parse -- parses a string into an expression
  * eval  -- evaluates an expression
  * print -- prints an expression to stdout, followed by a line break

* An impressive collection of memory leaks.

* No tail recursion.
